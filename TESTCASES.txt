                                    NOTES
================================================================================

1. Configuration Management:
   - All URLs, selectors, and test data are managed through ConfigService
   - Environment-specific configurations can be added easily

2. Data Management:
   - User registration creates test-user.json file
   - Login tests can use saved credentials from registration
   - Timestamps ensure unique test data for each run
   - DataPersistenceService manages credential storage and retrieval

3. Error Handling:
   - Tests include proper wait conditions
   - Page load states are verified before interactions

4. Maintenance:
   - SOLID principles ensure easy maintenance and extension
   - New tests can leverage existing services and factories

5. Future Enhancements:
   - Additional page objects can extend BasePage
   - New test scenarios can reuse existing services
   - Configuration can be extended for multiple environments
   - Additional API endpoints can be added to ConfigService and ApiService
   - Session management and authentication state can be extended
   - Cross-test data sharing can be expanded through DataPersistenceService
