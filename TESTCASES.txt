                                    NOTES
================================================================================

1. Configuration Management:
   - All URLs, selectors, and test data are managed through ConfigService
   - Environment-specific configurations can be added easily

2. Data Management:
   - User registration creates test-user.json file
   - Login tests can use saved credentials from registration
   - Timestamps ensure unique test data for each run
   - DataPersistenceService manages credential storage and retrieval

3. Error Handling:
   - Tests include proper wait conditions
   - Page load states are verified before interactions

4. Maintenance:
   - SOLID principles ensure easy maintenance and extension
   - New tests can leverage existing services and factories

5. Page Objects Added:
   - LoginPage: Handles UI login form interactions and validation
   - MyAccountPage: Handles authenticated user actions and logout
   - RegistrationPage: Handles user registration form and validation
   - MainMenuPage: Handles main menu hover and category navigation
   - ProductListingPage: Handles product browsing and adding to compare/wishlist/cart
   - ComparePage: Handles product comparison page interactions
   - ChangePasswordPage: Handles password change form and validation
   - WishlistPage: Handles wishlist page interactions and product management
   - CartPage: Handles shopping cart interactions, product management, and cart clearing
   - BlogPage: Handles blog posts filtering and author verification
   - ProductFilterPage: Handles product filtering by category, price, and brand
   - EditAccountPage: Handles account information updates (name, email, telephone)
   - EditAddressPage: Handles address book management and address updates
   - AffiliateTrackingPage: Handles affiliate tracking code retrieval and product URL tracking
   - OrderDetailsPage: Handles order history viewing and return initiation
   - ReturnsPage: Handles returns page interactions and status verification

6. Future Enhancements:
   - Additional page objects can extend BasePage
   - New test scenarios can reuse existing services
   - Configuration can be extended for multiple environments
   - Additional API endpoints can be added to ConfigService and ApiService
   - Session management and authentication state can be extended
   - Cross-test data sharing can be expanded through DataPersistenceService
